# About Me

Welcome to my homepage! I am Haotian Huang. I am a senior-year undergraduate student major in mathmathics at Sun Yat-sen University. 

Currently, I'm a research intern supervised by [Yisen Wang](https://yisenwang.github.io/). I am interested in self-supervised learning, both theory and application.
